Howdy!

I assume you all know what the Turing Machine is; a seemingly archaic and boring theoretical construct used to prove computation is possible. 
However, Alan Turing was certainly not a boring man.  A cool British guy like that had to like the best jazz of the time...for instance, 
he probably liked artists such as Nat King Cole and Miles Davis.  He probably liked artists such as these so much, in fact, that he probably
tried to write his own data miner using his very own Turing Machine in order to determine where they were most popular, so he could give them
advice on where to tour!  Sadly, the Turing Machine is theoretical, and Al Gore hadn't invented the internet yet.  

Fast forward another 60 years or so, and such a thing is now possible with social networking sites such as Last.fm!  Indeed, we have carried
on the good name of Alan Turing by inventing the Touring Machine.  Simply type in the name of an artist or band name
in the field provided, and form a tour.  Our magnificent machine has the ability to visualize where you will want to travel in order to build a tour
by finding where the artist you entered is most popular according to data acquired from Last.fm.  In addition, the Touring Machine will give you
suggestions on who you may wish to tour with!  

No longer will you be left wondering where to schedule gigs.  With the Touring Machine, nearly anything is possible!  (for everything possible, please
see the Turing Machine).
