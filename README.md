TouringMachine
==============

CSCE 470 Project which allows you to construct a euler tour of the cities that
like your band/artist the most! It will also recommend similar artists to play
with in each city.


To run main code, type in the following command:

python parse_data_dumps.py "dream theater"

Where "dream theater" may be your favorite band.  After entering the command, the script will output the band's most popular cities and it's tags.  To run tests, simply type "nosetests" at the root directory.
